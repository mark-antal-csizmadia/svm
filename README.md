# Support Vector Machines (SVMs) from scratch, without using dedicated packages, for the calssification of linearly and non-linearly separable data

Explores the theory and pracitcal implementation of SVMs. Inlcudes the optimization of the dual formulation, the implementation of different kernels such as linear, polynomial, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, and adding slack variables.
